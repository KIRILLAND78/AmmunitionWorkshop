Ammunition Workshop is a mod to satiate all your ammunition needs*!
It adds around 20 new ammo types! Some comes with special mechanics!
Bullets for mages! Bullets for freezing enemies! Bullets for all purposes!

Also this mod introduces ammunition layouts mechanic**!
Having hard time choosing between ichor and crystal bullets? Why not use both?
Make your own ammunition layouts!
Change your ammunition layouts with a hotkey! No need to constantly switch ammo types!

*no rockets or arrows though.
**might be bugged when using with other mods messing with projectile consumption.
i do not guarantee flawless work.
